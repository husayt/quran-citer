# quran-citer


This project allows to easily create simple quran links.


Just add any Quran surah either in `blockquote` or `q` tags.

```
<blockquote qlink="tanzil">
  Thereby He causes many to go astray, and thereby He guides many; but thereby He
  causes none to go astray save the iniquitous} <a>(Al-Baqarah 2:26)</a>
</blockquote>
```

if you want to use some other quran website use `qlink` attribute


<blockquote class="qrn" qlink="tanzil">
  Thereby He causes many to go astray, and thereby He guides many; but thereby He
  causes none to go astray save the iniquitous} <a>(Al-Baqarah 2:26)</a>
</blockquote>
